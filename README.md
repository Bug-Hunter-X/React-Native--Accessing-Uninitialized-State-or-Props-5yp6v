# React Native Uninitialized State/Prop Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access state or props before they've been initialized.  This typically occurs during the component mounting process or when dealing with asynchronous data fetching.

## Problem

Accessing `this.state` or `this.props` variables prematurely, before they've been populated with values, can lead to undefined behavior, unexpected crashes, or runtime errors.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing proper error handling and ensuring asynchronous operations update the state correctly before accessing state variables in the render method.

- **Conditional Rendering:** Use conditional rendering to display a loading indicator or placeholder content while the data is being fetched.

- **Asynchronous State Updates:**  Always update the state in the callback provided by the asynchronous operation, such as `setState` after a successful `fetch` call.

- **Default Values:** If possible, set a default value for the state property which is a non-undefined value and does not throw an error.
